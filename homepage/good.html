            <h1>My name is Kevin Li</h1>
            <p>I am currently a 4th year CS student at the University of Alberta and will hopefully be graduating at the end of this semester.</p>
            <p>	
                I was born in Edmonton and have a strong desire to travel outside of Canada. I've only been to the US and China,
                but I would love to one day visit some European countries and other countries in Asia. Some things I enjoy doing 
                in my spare time are games, which includes board games and video games.
